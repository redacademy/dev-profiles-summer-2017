<h3>Life Before RED:</h3>
<br>
        <p>I just graduated from UBC this spring with a BFA in visual art. Over the past few years I have been participating in exhibitions and working at galleries.</p></br>
        
        <h4>Interesting Fact:</h4>
       
      <br>  <p>I grew up moving around a lot and went to high school in London. </p></br>
        
        <br><h5>Stuff I Like To Do:</h5></br>
        <ul>
      <li>painting, drawing, printmaking</li>
      <li>making fancy desserts (& eating them too) </li>
       <li>hiking, camping, generally being outdoors</li>
        <li>woodworking, ceramics and photography</li>
        
</ul>

<br><h6>Goals</h6></br>
<!--Redo the "Classes ID's and Div's" lesson so this doesn't happen again--> To become a front-end developer with a strong understanding of design principles whilst continuing to create art.
